This directory contains the data files necessary to walk through the documentation.
The full data sets used in the paper are not given since they aren't technically mine to give, but the provided snippets (~10%) should
be sufficient to run the system and see how everything works.

Also in this directory are the English and Spanish WordNet files, which are read in when featurizing pairs of definitions.
Technically, the python library nltk has an interface for WordNet, which theoretically could be used instead, but the files in this directory were used
to remain consistent with a previous version of the system that was not written in python.
